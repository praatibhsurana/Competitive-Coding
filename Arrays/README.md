## Arrays
I've added the question along with the sample input and output on top of each code. Additionally, I've also added comments at the end of each code regarding how I approached the problem and what mistake I was making.

Articles/Material I referred to when facing difficulties:

- [Sorting Algorithms - Slowest to Fastest](https://medium.com/javarevisited/sorting-algorithms-slowest-to-fastest-a9f0e30937b9)
- [Minimum Swaps in an array - Discussion](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/minimum-swaps-2/forum)
