## Strings

I've added the question along with the sample input and output on top of each code. Additionally, I've also added comments at the end of each code regarding how I approached the problem and what mistake I was making. 

Articles/Material I referred to when facing difficulties:
- [Sherlock and the Valid String using collections library Python](https://www.thepoorcoder.com/hackerrank-sherlock-and-the-valid-string-solution/)
- [Special String Again](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/special-palindrome-again/forum/comments/526802)
